# House-Prices-Machine-Learning-Project
In this notebook, we will be going through a machine learning project initiated by Kaggle, with the goal of predicting the sale price of houses.

### Problem statement
For this project, the question we are trying to answer is:

Given the characteristics of previous examples of similar houses that have been sold, how well can we predict the future sale price of a house?

### Data
The data can be found on the Kaggle website:
  - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neolen-house-price-prediction/data

### Evaluation
For this problem, Kaggle has set the evaluation metric to be Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE). 

As with other regression evaluations, the goal is to get the RMSLE of our machine learning model to be as low as possible.

### Methods
Several machine learning algorithms will be used to get the lowest RMSLE possible.
